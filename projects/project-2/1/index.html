  <h1> i had a dream that I was best friends with nick jonas, except he liked me more than i liked him. i was walking through new york and every time i turned a corner he would be there and run at me with open arms and go “EYYY YOUUUUU!!!” in like a really bad chicago accent. It was also around Christmas time so New York was decked out with Holiday decorations. </h1>
