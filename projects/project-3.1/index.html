<h2> Brooklyn Public Library’s founding dates to an 1892 act of the state legislature “to establish and to maintain a public library and reading room” in the independent city of Brooklyn. Following the consolidation of Greater New York, the library system grew along with the borough it served.</h2></div>

    <h3>Library construction boomed in Brooklyn in the early 20th century thanks to a $1.6 million investment from industrialist Andrew Carnegie. His legacy is visible today in neighborhoods throughout the borough, as 18 of Brooklyn’s 21 original Carnegie libraries remain in service. These buildings are architectural gems, stately and ornate, many situated in the heart of residential areas.</h3></div>

        <h4>Construction began on a grand Central Library in 1912, but the project was shelved for nearly three decades as a result of financial issues brought on by the First World War and the Great Depression. Central Library finally opened on Grand Army Plaza in 1941, becoming the system’s hub and by far its largest facility.</h4></div>

            <h5>Library service expanded in the middle of the twentieth century with the construction of branches to serve both new and underserved neighborhoods. Many of the new libraries were constructed during the administration of Mayor John Lindsay and are identifiable by their functional, no-frills design and open floorplans.</h5></div>
